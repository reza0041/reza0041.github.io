        <p>
        My name is Ali Rezaie, I am 25 years old. I have always wanted to study something related to what I used to 
        do as a kid. As a student of grade 5<sup>th</sup> I started taking art classes for 5 years,  and also got interesed in 
        photography. Art helped me see the world from a different perspective, also it led me to learn about 
        Graphic Design and tattoo industry.</p> 

        <p>
        In the past 2 years I have gained passion for videography as well. In the
        process of learning all of these skills I was looking for a prorgram where I could add more knowledge to these variety
        of skills and a friend of mine suggested me about this program <abbr title="interactive media design">IMD</abbr> and here I met with <em>Web Developement, Digital Graphics, Design Foundations</em> etc.
        I accept the challenges and thrilled to learn more, as one of my favourite artists said: <q>I am seeking, I am striving,
        I am in it with all my heart.</q> <cite> (Vincent Van Gogh, n.d.) </cite>
