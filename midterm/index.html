                Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating marine creatures 
                found in oceans around the world. Despite their name, they are not 
                fish but echinoderms, belonging to the same family as sea urchins and 
                sand dollars. Starfish have a unique radial symmetry, typically displaying 
                five arms radiating from a central disc, although some species can have more. 
                Their vibrant colors range from reds and oranges to blues and purples. 
                Starfish are known for their remarkable ability to regenerate lost limbs, 
                and some species can even regenerate an entire new body from just a portion of an arm.
                 They are predatory and feed mainly on mollusks like clams and oysters. 
                 Using their tube feet, which are located on the underside of their arms, 
                 they pry open shells and use their stomach to digest prey externally. 
                 Starfish play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by maintaining 
                 the balance of marine populations.
